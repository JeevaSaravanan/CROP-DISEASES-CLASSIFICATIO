This system which supports the farmer in identifying crop diseases. The recent advancement in computer vision, neural networks, and increasing global smartphone usage made it possible. 
The primary objective is to distinguish the illness introduced in plants by capturing its morphology by picture handling and deep learning. This will feed on the farmer’s plant image and
the convolutional neural network helps in deriving a better conclusion using statistical methods. ​This has a user-friendly mobile application which serves as a portal for the farmers to 
identify and get remedy for their problems.
                                
The tedious process of manual classification is automated, and anyone anywhere can be benefited using this system. This could be additional support for the farmers.
